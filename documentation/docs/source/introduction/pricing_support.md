#### Managed Services and Support

Our managed infrastructure, support, and training packages are designed to help organizations who want to control how they run ContraxSuite, but need some help to do it. We know that not every organization has the same internal resources or use cases, so we offer fixed-price packages to help organizations quickly select the right plan.

[Visit our Managed Services and Support page](https://contraxsuite.com/contraxsuite-hosting-and-support/).

For organizations who want to learn more about how we can help meet requirements above and beyond these packages, read the "Commercial Closed Source License" section below.

#### Commercial Closed Source License

Some of our most successful projects have involved custom implementions of ContraxSuite. We know that for many organizations, no product is a perfect fit off the shelf. Our implementation and customization services can help organizations who want to configure or customize ContraxSuite for specific business processes, technical requirements, or document use cases. Not every organization has the same resources available or applications in mind, so we’ve built ContraxSuite to address this. The last mile problem is real, and we’re here to help.

#### LexNLP Features

LexNLPâ„¢ by LexPredict is the leading open source information retrieval and extraction tool for real, unstructured legal text. LexNLP is for developers and other parties who need to solve problems involving contracts, plans, policies, procedures, and other material. Developers and other parties can use LexNLP to build their own solutions, or extract custom data from legal or financial documents. Corporate legal departments, law firms, financial institutions, publicly-traded companies, insurance companies, accountants, and auditors can all benefit from LexNLP.

###### Extract Legal Terms

Legal domain-specific text:

* Effective dates, termination dates, or delivery dates
* Persons and organizations
* Terms, notice periods, or assignment delays
* References to citations or regulations like "26 U.S.C. 501," "26 CFR 31.3121," or "655 F.3d 1013"
* References to courts or regulators
* Controlling law and jurisdictions
* Copyrights and trademarks
* Phrasal definitions like "Default shall mean..."

###### Tokenization and Segmentation

Other libraries struggle with headings and sections, or they stumble over common abbreviations like "U.S.C." LexNLP tokenizes and segments, leaving nothing behind:

* Pages, paragraphs, and sentences
* Tokens, stems, and stopwords
* Titles, articles, sections
* Exhibits and schedules
* Tables of contents

###### Clustering and Classification

LexNLP can cluster and classify data in intuitive ways:

* Sentences, paragraphs, clauses, sections, and documents
* Documents as legal or non-legal material
* Documents as financial or non-financial material
* Contracts among various contract types
* Clauses among various clause types
* By using deep semantic models to find synonyms or related concepts
